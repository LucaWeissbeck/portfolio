During my studies a practical work experience phase alternates with a university phase every 3-4 months. Due to my free choice of internship placement I am able to gain insights into different business units and work on real-world client facing projects. ",

During my time at the department I was tasked with finding algorithms that give an answer to the research question; \"Is there too much information given in newspaper articles in context surrounding particular negative events when involving members of a minority group?\". Answers to this question may be found by analysis of racial bias. An elevated amount of hedges, boosters or factive verbs in articles may be one of the many factors portraying such a bias by the newspaper author.\nThe analysis were conducted in Python using a Dataframe containing the article content and other metadata.\n\nTechnology stack: Python, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, TextBlob, Sci-kit-learn, IBM Cloud, IBM Watson Natural Language Processing, CoreNLP"

Sequelize is an Object-relational mapping framework used to communicate with the database.  Furthermore, I gained insights into the AWS Cloud and was able to achieve the AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate.  Technology stack: AngularJS, Javascript, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, AWS Cloud"
